To compile the TAEF project, you must install TAEF.  Here's how:

1) Install Windows Driver Kit (WDK 10, version 1607) at https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=526733  More information can be found at  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit  This will install the TAEF MSI.

2) Now run, "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Testing\Runtimes\Test Authoring and Execution Framework x64-x64_en-us.msi" which installs TAEF to "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Testing"

3) Now you can build & run Microsoft.Xbox.Services.UnitTest.140.TAEF.sln
